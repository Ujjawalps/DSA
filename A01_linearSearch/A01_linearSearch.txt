ðŸ“˜ A01_LinearSearch â€“ Interview Notes

Algorithm: Linear Search
-----------------------
- Linear Search (Sequential Search) checks each element in the array/list one by one.
- Time Complexity:
    â€¢ Best Case â†’ O(1) (element at first position)
    â€¢ Worst Case â†’ O(n) (element at last position or not present)
    â€¢ Average Case â†’ O(n)
- Space Complexity â†’ O(1) (in-place)

Key Points:
-------------
- Works on both sorted and unsorted arrays.
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Inefficient for large datasets.
- Returns index of found element; -1 if not found.

Variants:
----------
1. Search in 1D array
2. Search in 2D array
3. Search in String (character search)
4. Search in range of indices

Tips for Interviews:
--------------------
- Always check array bounds to avoid IndexOutOfBoundsException.
- Can be implemented with loops or recursion.
- Explain best, worst, and average case complexity.
- Mention differences with Binary Search (requires sorted array, O(log n)).

Example (pseudocode):
---------------------
for i = 0 to n-1:
    if arr[i] == target:
        return i
return -1
