ABSTRACTION IN JAVA

Definition:
- Hiding implementation, exposing only essential features.

Achieved By:
1. Abstract Classes (0–100% abstraction)
   - `abstract class` with abstract + concrete methods.
2. Interfaces (100% abstraction before Java 8)
   - Can only define method signatures (till Java 7).
   - From Java 8 onwards → default & static methods allowed.

Difference from Encapsulation:
- Encapsulation → hides DATA (fields).
- Abstraction → hides IMPLEMENTATION (methods).
