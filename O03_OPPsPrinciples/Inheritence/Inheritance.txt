INHERITANCE IN JAVA

1. Single Inheritance → Child extends one parent.
2. Multilevel Inheritance → Child → Parent → Grandparent.
3. Hierarchical Inheritance → Multiple children from same parent.
4. Multiple Inheritance → Not supported directly in Java (ambiguity problem),
   solved using INTERFACES.

Key Keywords:
- `extends` → used for classes
- `super` → to call parent constructor or methods
- Constructor chaining happens top-down (parent → child).

Example: Box → BoxWithWeight → BoxWithPrice
