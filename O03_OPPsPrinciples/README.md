# ðŸ“˜ OOPs Principles in Java

This module covers the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** with code examples, interview-prep notes, and revision PDFs.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Principles of OOP
1. **Inheritance** â†’ Reusing code using parent-child relationships.
2. **Polymorphism** â†’ Methods behaving differently based on context.
3. **Encapsulation** â†’ Wrapping data with methods, restricting direct access.
4. **Abstraction** â†’ Hiding implementation, exposing only essentials.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- **Inheritance/**
    - Demonstrates single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance (via interfaces).
- **Polymorphism/**
    - Shows method overloading (compile-time) and method overriding (runtime).
- **Encapsulation/**
    - Example using `Student` class with private fields and getters/setters.
- **Abstraction/**
    - Abstract class & interface examples.

## ðŸ“„ Notes & Interview Prep
- **OOPs003.txt** â†’ Short interview-prep notes (Q&A style).
- **OOPs003.pdf** â†’ Detailed notes (theory + diagrams).

---

## âœ… Quick Recap
- **Inheritance** â†’ Code Reusability
- **Polymorphism** â†’ Flexibility
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Data Security
- **Abstraction** â†’ Design Simplicity
