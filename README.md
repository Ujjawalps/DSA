# 🧠 DSA Java Practice

This repository contains my personal Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice code in Java, along with my OOPs learning journey.
The repo is organized by topic, with separate folders for algorithms, patterns, recursion, and OOPs concepts

## 📘 OOPs Learning Notes  

I am documenting my daily OOPs learning:  

Each OOPs folder contains:  
- 📄 **PDF** → Detailed notes from the day.  
- 📝 **TXT** → Short revision notes (quick recap for interviews).  

So far these folders have notes:  

- [**O01_OPPsIntroduction**](./O01_OPPsIntroduction) → Classes, Objects, Constructors, `this`, Wrapper classes, `final`, Garbage Collection.  
- [**O02_OPPsPackages**](./O02_OPPsPackages) → Packages, `import`, `static`, Inner Classes, Singleton Pattern.
- [**O03_OPPsPrinciples**](./O03_OPPsPrinciples) → Inheritance, `super`, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction


## 🚀 How to Run

You can run any `.java` file using:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```
Or use IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code for easier navigation and execution.
